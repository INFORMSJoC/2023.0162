# Results from the paper

This directory contains the computational results presented in the paper. 

They can be replicated by using the scripts exe.py and exe_newton.py in the scripts directory.

The pdf file "Parameter Configuration Tests.pdf" gives an overview on the parameter settings that were used for our computational experiments.
In particular, it allows to identify which results directory is associated with which specific test case.

Each subdirectory contains the results for one specific test case, with one file per test problem.
Each individual result file contains a solution status, the problem name, the final lower bound, the final upper bound, the box which is examined at termination, the number
of iterations until first feasibility verification, the time in seconds until first feasibility verification and the total time in seconds.
